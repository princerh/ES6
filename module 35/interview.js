/* 1. tell me something about js engine v8 internal mechanism 

V8 is an open-source JavaScript engine developed by Google for the Chrome browser and Node.js runtime. It's written in C++ and is highly optimized for performance. Here's a brief overview of some key aspects of V8's internal mechanism:

Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation: V8 uses a JIT compiler to improve performance. It first interprets JavaScript code and then compiles frequently executed parts of the code into machine code for faster execution.

Memory Management: V8 has a garbage collector that automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation. It uses generational garbage collection techniques to efficiently reclaim memory.

Execution Pipeline: V8 processes JavaScript code through multiple stages, including parsing, optimizing, and generating machine code. It applies various optimization techniques, such as inlining, function specialization, and type inference, to generate efficient machine code.

Hidden Classes and Inline Caching: V8 optimizes property access by using hidden classes to represent object shapes and inline caching to speed up property lookups. This optimization reduces the overhead of dynamic property access.

Event Loop Integration: In the context of Node.js, V8 integrates with the event loop to provide asynchronous I/O operations. It cooperates with the libuv library to handle I/O tasks efficiently while ensuring responsiveness.

Profiler and Debugger Support: V8 includes built-in profiling and debugging tools to analyze JavaScript code performance and debug applications. These tools help developers identify performance bottlenecks and diagnose issues.

Isolation and Sandboxing: V8 supports isolates, which are independent JavaScript execution contexts with their own heap and garbage collector. This feature enables sandboxing and isolation of JavaScript code, making it suitable for environments like web browsers and server-side applications.

Overall, V8's internal mechanisms are designed to provide high-performance execution of JavaScript code while optimizing memory usage and enabling seamless integration with various runtime environments. */

/* 2. what is event loop in javascript 

The event loop is a crucial concept in JavaScript that enables asynchronous programming. It's responsible for handling and processing asynchronous events, such as user input, network requests, and timers, in a non-blocking manner.

Here's how the event loop works:

Execution Stack: JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can only execute one piece of code at a time. The execution stack is where function calls are queued and executed synchronously. When a function is called, it's added to the top of the stack and executed, and when it completes, it's removed from the stack.

Event Queue: Asynchronous events, such as DOM events (e.g., click, mousemove), timer callbacks (e.g., setTimeout, setInterval), and network requests, are placed in the event queue when they occur. Each event is associated with a callback function that should be executed when the event is processed.

Event Loop: The event loop continuously checks the execution stack and the event queue. If the execution stack is empty and there are events in the queue, the event loop takes an event from the queue and pushes its associated callback function onto the execution stack. The callback function is then executed, and the process repeats.

The key aspect of the event loop is that it allows JavaScript to handle asynchronous tasks without blocking the main execution thread. This is essential for building responsive and interactive web applications where tasks like fetching data from a server or responding to user input need to be performed asynchronously without freezing the UI.

It's important to note that the event loop is a fundamental part of the JavaScript runtime environment and is not directly accessible from JavaScript code. Developers interact with it indirectly by using asynchronous APIs provided by the browser or runtime environment, such as setTimeout, fetch, or DOM event listeners. */

/* 3. if javascript is single threaded, then how does it handle asynchronous call

JavaScript is indeed single-threaded, meaning it has only one execution thread, and code is executed sequentially, one statement at a time. However, JavaScript can still handle asynchronous operations efficiently through mechanisms like asynchronous callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax. Here's how it works:

Asynchronous Callbacks: JavaScript uses callbacks to handle asynchronous operations. When an asynchronous operation (such as fetching data from a server or waiting for a timer to expire) is initiated, instead of blocking the execution thread, JavaScript provides a callback function that will be called when the operation completes. Meanwhile, the execution thread can continue to execute other code.

Event Loop: While the asynchronous operation is in progress, the event loop continuously checks for completed asynchronous tasks and their corresponding callbacks. When an asynchronous task completes, its callback is placed in the event queue.

Event Queue: Callbacks from completed asynchronous operations are stored in the event queue. The event loop picks up these callbacks from the event queue and executes them one by one, ensuring they're executed in the order they were received, and only when the execution stack is empty. This allows JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations in a non-blocking manner, maintaining responsiveness and avoiding UI freezes.

Promises and async/await: Promises and async/await syntax are higher-level abstractions built on top of callbacks, providing more readable and manageable code for handling asynchronous operations. Promises represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and allow chaining of operations. Async functions, marked by the async keyword, enable asynchronous code to be written in a synchronous-like manner using await to pause execution until a promise settles.

In summary, while JavaScript is single-threaded, it leverages asynchronous callbacks, the event loop, and higher-level abstractions like promises and async/await to handle asynchronous operations efficiently and maintain responsiveness in applications. */

/* 4. differences between setTimout() and setInterval()

setTimeout() and setInterval() are both functions in JavaScript used to execute code asynchronously after a specified delay. However, they differ in how they handle the timing of execution and whether they repeat.

Here are the key differences between setTimeout() and setInterval():

Timing:

setTimeout(): Executes the specified function once after the specified delay (in milliseconds).
setInterval(): Executes the specified function repeatedly at a specified interval (in milliseconds), starting after the initial delay.
Repetition:

setTimeout(): Executes the function only once after the specified delay.
setInterval(): Executes the function repeatedly at the specified interval until it's cleared using clearInterval().
Here's a summary of the differences:

setTimeout() is used when you want to execute a function once after a delay.
setInterval() is used when you want to execute a function repeatedly at a specified interval.
It's important to note that both setTimeout() and setInterval() are asynchronous, meaning they don't block the execution of other code. However, it's generally recommended to use setTimeout() over setInterval() if you want to avoid potential issues with overlapping executions, especially if the execution time of the function is longer than the specified interval. */

/* 5. Can you explain the difference between async/await and promise 

Promises:

Promises are objects that represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
Promises have three states: pending, fulfilled (resolved), or rejected.
Promises are created using the new Promise() constructor or by using utility functions like Promise.resolve() and Promise.reject().
Promises use the .then() method to handle success cases and the .catch() method to handle errors.
Promises allow chaining using multiple .then() calls, which makes them suitable for composing asynchronous operations sequentially.
Promises offer a more low-level and explicit approach to handling asynchronous code.

Async/Await:

Async functions are a syntactic sugar built on top of promises, making asynchronous code look and behave more like synchronous code.
Async functions are declared using the async keyword before the function declaration.
Within async functions, you can use the await keyword to pause the execution of the function until a promise is settled (resolved or rejected).
Async functions automatically return a promise, and the resolved value of the promise is whatever the async function returns, or it will be the value to which the promise returned by the async function is resolved.
Async functions make asynchronous code easier to read and write, especially for handling multiple asynchronous operations sequentially or conditionally.

In summary, promises provide a more explicit and versatile way to handle asynchronous operations, while async/await offers a cleaner and more concise syntax for writing asynchronous code, making it easier to read and maintain. Async/await is built on top of promises and is widely used in modern JavaScript codebases for handling asynchronous operations. */

/* 7. can you explain what the .then() method does

The .then() method is a fundamental part of the Promise API in JavaScript, used for handling asynchronous operations and their eventual results or errors. It allows you to specify what to do once a promise is resolved (fulfilled) or rejected.

Here's how the .then() method works:

Chaining: The .then() method is typically chained onto a promise object. When the promise is settled (either resolved or rejected), the .then() method is called.

Syntax: The .then() method takes one or two arguments: the fulfillment handler (onFulfilled) and the rejection handler (onRejected). These arguments are callback functions that will be executed when the promise is resolved or rejected, respectively.

Returning Values: The fulfillment handler (onFulfilled) receives the resolved value of the promise as its argument. It can perform some processing on this value and optionally return a new value or another promise. If a value is returned, it becomes the resolved value of the promise returned by the .then() call.

Error Handling: If the promise is rejected, the rejection handler (onRejected) is called with the reason for the rejection (usually an error). It allows you to handle errors and perform error recovery or propagation as needed. If no rejection handler is provided, the error will propagate to the next .catch() block in the promise chain.

Overall, the .then() method is a powerful tool for handling asynchronous operations and composing asynchronous code in a readable and maintainable way. */
